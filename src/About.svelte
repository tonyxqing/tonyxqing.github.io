        <p>
            I'm a software developer with over a year of professional frontend experience in mobile and web applications. 
            I get satisfication from converting mockups and design specifications into functional user friendly websites. 
            Currently, I am based in Chicago working remotely for TCAT, which is a research center at Texas A&M, 
            coding web and mobile solutions in React and React Native. In my freetime I am practicing backend skills 
            using Rust and MongoDB to create the backbone of my card trading game. Aside from work, I love to spend
            time with my wife, cook new recipies, and helping beginners learn to code.
